# Credit Rating Prediction
## Deep Learning with Neural Networks and Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)

Similar to the classifier in the second project of this portfolio, this project continues to explore the question of predicting the credit rating of a corporation given its finanical indicators. Are we able to predict the credit ratings of corporations given historical ratings data and the financials of the companies?

To answer the questions above, I built two Neural Networks with ReLU and sigmoid activation functions and a Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network model to predict companies credit ratings based on historical ratings and financial indicators.

Of all three neural networks we created, none of them have a satisfiactory accuracy of over 50% (even lower than the random forest classifier in the last project). This is mainly due to the fact that the models are based on a limited number of data points and there are more complicated features than just the financial performance indicators to predict the credit ratings of companies. Future improvements can be feeding more data and including more features in the data set to train the model.
